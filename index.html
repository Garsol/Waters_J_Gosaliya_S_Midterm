        <p> Lies! Why do we have to tell lies? It is quite simple question but certainly an unsolved answer. Why we lie, to hide our secrets, to hide the truth, to cover up
            our mistakes. It is because we have corrupted our souls with the mistakes so often that we have made the lies our reality and we have forgotten what the actual truth is.

        </p>

        <p> Lies are for weak hearted people who do not seek courage to stand the truth. It is a weapon for cowards. When we see the children making a mistake they
            have this tendancy to lie because they believe they are gonna be punished if they tell the truth, so not being able to speak the truth is the sign of misleading
            upbringing. Even in the history, we have evidence what lies have done to the humanity, wars, slaughter and unimaginable things.
          </p>

        <P>  Even in the eyes of spirituality, lies are considered as the thing of dark times; a SIN! which we should avoid at any cost and that is what we
            have been being taught from our early age. There's a heaven in afterlife and in order to reach there we must have committed no sins or less sins but look around
        from the moment we wake up till the time we go to bed we lie so many times even for a slightest thing which has no need like a fool. This foolishness is the 
    result of lying and sooner or later it will have a cost to pay, a debt which can never be paid. </h3></P>

    <p> Lies are filled with false information, it defies one's emotion, breaks their heart and shatters them from inside. Consider a situation where a 
        person is seeking help from somebody and his or her expectations are ruined because of somebody's idea of having a prank with a lie which is not only bad but worst 
        in terms of a person's trust. Emotions like trust, believe, faith, hope and most importantly love, are hugely devastated when encountered with lies. Why do you
        think the world is so broken, it is indeed because of the lies. Think of the world where everyone speaks the truth where nobody has ill thoughts to hide, it would be
        a the most happiest place.
    </p>


    <p>  What is the harm in telling the truth, in accepting your mistakes and in confronting the reality? What is the worst that can happen? Whatever it would be it has been 
        done and we can not undo it but we can change it and lies are certainly not the way to do to. It will only make it worst, there's a saying,'It takes a hundred lies to hide one'.
        So, don't you thin it is better to give up on falsifying and start telling the truth, it is never too late to change. Lies are indeed bad!
